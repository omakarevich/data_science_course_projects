The supermarket is introducing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. 

It will help determine the age of customers in order to:

- Analyze purchases and offer products that may interest buyers in this age group;
- Monitor the cashiers when selling alcohol.

We have a set of photographs of people with age indication.

Build a model that will determine the approximate age of the person from the photograph with MAE < 7
