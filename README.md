Here is my projects from online course "Data science"
1) Tariffs recommendation - my first little project. Only to understand something about DS.
2) Bank customers churn - Supervised learning, unbalanced data, F1, AUC-ROC, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier.
3) Choose region for oil development - Supervised learning, RMSE, confidence interval, Bootstrap, StandardScaler, LinearRegression.
4) Prototype model for a metalworking company - Supervised learning, matplotlib, sMAPE, DecisionTreeRegressor, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor
5) Algorithm for data protection - very short project, supervised learning, r2_score, matrix, LinearRegression.
