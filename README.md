Here is my projects from online course "Data science"
1) Tariffs recommendation - my first little project. Only to understand something about DS.
2) Bank customers churn - supervised learning, unbalanced data, F1, AUC-ROC, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier.
3) Choose region for oil development - supervised learning, RMSE, confidence interval, Bootstrap, StandardScaler, LinearRegression.
4) Prototype model for a metalworking company - supervised learning, matplotlib, sMAPE, DecisionTreeRegressor, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor.
5) Algorithm for data protection - very short project, supervised learning, r2_score, matrix, LinearRegression.
6) Car price prediction - supervised learning, gradient descent, numerical analysis, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, LGBMRegressor.
7) Predicting taxi orders - supervised learning, statsmodels, seasonal_decompose,  RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, LGBMRegressor.
8) Comments —Ålassification - supervised learning, nltk, TfidfVectorizer, CatBoostClassifier, LGBMClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier.
9) To be continied...
