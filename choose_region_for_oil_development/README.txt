Decide where to drill the new well: choos—É the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss.

Collected characteristics of oil sample for wells: oil quality and volume of its reserves in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known.

Result:
- A model predict the volume of reserves in new wells.

- Wells with the highest estimated values were selected.

- The regions with the maximum total profit of the selected wells have been identified.

- A model has been built to determine the region where production will bring the greatest profit. 

- Potential profits and risks were analyzed using Bootstrap.
